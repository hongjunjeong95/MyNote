# Lambda@Edge Pratice

## Step 1 - Create S3 bucket

1. Choose **Create bucket**.

2. For **Bucket name**, enter a bucket name.

3. For **Region**, choose an AWS Region for your bucket. We recommend that you choose a Region close to you to optimize latency and minimize costs, or you might choose another Region to address regulatory requirements.

4. In the **Block Public Access settings for bucket** section, clear the check box for **Block \*all\* public access**.

   * You must allow public read access to the bucket and files so that CloudFront URLs can serve content from the bucket. However, you can restrict access to specific content by using the CloudFront private content feature. For more information, see [Serving private content with signed URLs and signed cookies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html).

5. Select the check box for **I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public.**.

6. Leave all other settings at their defaults, and then choose **Create bucket**.

7. (Optional) If you don’t have your own website content, or if you just want to experiment with CloudFront before uploading your own content, use the following link to download a simple *hello world* webpage: [hello-world-html.zip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/samples/hello-world-html.zip).

8. In the **Buckets** section, choose your new bucket, and then choose **Upload**.

9. Use the **Upload** page to add your content to the S3 bucket. If you downloaded the simple *hello world* webpage, add the `index.html` file and the `css` folder (with the `style.css` file inside it).

10. At the bottom of the page, choose **Upload**.

11. Choose **Permissions** on nav-bar

12. Edit **Bucket policy** and copy & paste below to let users access static page

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::hongjunbucket/*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    

13. After the upload is complete, you can navigate to the item by using its URL. For example:

    ```html
    https://<bucket name>.s3-<AWS Region>.amazonaws.com/<object name>
    ```

## Step 2 - Create a CloudFront distribution

1. Choose **Create Distribution**, and then choose **Get Started**.

2. Under **Origin Settings**, for **Origin Domain Name**, choose the Amazon S3 bucket that you created earlier.

   For the other settings under **Origin Settings**, accept the default values.

3. For the settings under **Default Cache Behavior Settings**, accept the default values.

   For more information about cache behavior options, see [Cache Behavior Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior).

4. For the settings under **Distribution Settings**, accept the default values.

   For more information about distribution options, see [Distribution Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesGeneral).

5. At the bottom of the page, choose **Create Distribution**.

6. After CloudFront creates your distribution, the value of the **Status** column for your distribution changes from **In Progress** to **Deployed**. This typically takes a few minutes.

   Record the domain name that CloudFront assigns to your distribution, which appears in the list of distributions. (It also appears on the **General** tab for a selected distribution.) It looks similar to the following: `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`.

7. Access your content through CloudFront

   ```
   https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/index.html
   ```

## Step 3 - Create your function

1. Choose **Create function**.

2. On the **Create function** page, choose **Use a blueprint**, and then filter for the CloudFront blueprints by entering `cloudfront` in the search field. The **Keyword : cloudfront** is shown, and all the blueprints that are tagged for CloudFront are listed.

   > **Note** 
   >
   > CloudFront blueprints are available only in the **US-East-1 (N. Virginia)** Region (**us-east-1**).

3. Choose the **cloudfront-modify-response-header** blueprint as the template for your function.

4. Enter the following information about your function:

   - **Name**

     Enter a name for your function.

   - **Execution role**

     Choose how to set the permissions for your function. To use the recommended basic Lambda@Edge permissions policy template, choose **Create a new role from AWS policy templates**.

   - **Role name**

     Enter a name for the role that the policy template creates.

   - **Policy templates**

     Lambda automatically adds the policy template **Basic Edge Lambda permissions** because you chose a CloudFront blueprint as the basis for your function. This policy template adds execution role permissions that allow CloudFront to run your Lambda function for you in CloudFront locations around the world. For more information, see [Setting IAM permissions and roles for Lambda@Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-edge-permissions.html).

5. Choose **Create function**. Lambda creates the function, and on the next page you see your function configuration.

6. In the **Function overview** section of the page, choose **your function name**.

7. Choose **Code**

8. Choose **Edit code**

9. Copy & Paste below code

   ```javascript
   'use strict';
   exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
   
       //Get contents of response
       const response = event.Records[0].cf.response;
       const headers = response.headers;
   
       //Set new headers
       headers['strict-transport-security'] = [{key: 'Strict-Transport-Security', value: 'max-age= 63072000; includeSubdomains; preload'}];
       headers['content-security-policy'] = [{key: 'Content-Security-Policy', value: "default-src 'none'; img-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; object-src 'none'"}];
       headers['x-content-type-options'] = [{key: 'X-Content-Type-Options', value: 'nosniff'}];
       headers['x-frame-options'] = [{key: 'X-Frame-Options', value: 'DENY'}];
       headers['x-xss-protection'] = [{key: 'X-XSS-Protection', value: '1; mode=block'}];
       headers['referrer-policy'] = [{key: 'Referrer-Policy', value: 'same-origin'}];
   
       //Return modified response
       callback(null, response);
   };
   ```

10. Deploy

## Step 4 - Add a CloudFront trigger to run the function

1. In the **Function overview** section of the page, choose **CloudFront** or **Add trigger**.

   1. If you choose **Add trigger**, select **CloudFront** as trigger

2. Choose **Deploy to Lambda@Edge**.

3. On the **Deploy to Lambda@Edge** page, under **Configure CloudFront trigger**, enter the following information:

   - **Distribution**

     The CloudFront distribution ID to associate with your function. In the drop-down list, choose the distribution ID.

   - **Cache behavior**

     The cache behavior to use with the trigger. For this example, leave the value set to *****, which means your distribution’s default cache behavior. For more information, see [Cache Behavior Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior) in the [Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html) topic.

   - **CloudFront event**

     The trigger that specifies when your function runs. We want the security headers function to run whenever CloudFront returns a response from the origin. So in the drop-down list, choose **Origin response**. For more information, see [Adding triggers for a Lambda@Edge function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-edge-add-triggers.html).

4. Under **Confirm deploy to Lambda@Edge**, select the check box, which is *I acknowledge that on deploy a new version of this function will be published with the above trigger and replicated across all available AWS regions.*, to acknowledge that the trigger will be deployed and run your function in all AWS locations.

5. Choose **Deploy** to add the trigger and replicate the function to AWS locations worldwide. Then, if necessary, close the **Deploy to Lambda@Edge** page.

6. Wait for the function to replicate. This typically takes several minutes.

   You can check to see if replication is finished by [going to the CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home) and viewing your distribution. Wait for the distribution status to change from **In Progress** back to **Deployed**, which means that your function has been replicated. To verify that the function works, follow the steps in the next section.

## Step 5 - Verify that the function runs

1. In a browser, enter the URL for a file in your S3 bucket. For example, you might use a URL similar to `http://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/index.html`.

   For more information about the CloudFront domain name to use in the file URL, see [Customizing the URL Format for Files in CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/LinkFormat.html).

2. Open your browser’s Web Developer toolbar. For example, in your browser window in Chrome, open the context (right-click) menu, and then choose **Inspect**.

3. Choose the **Network** tab.

4. Reload the page to view your `index.html`, and then choose an HTTP request on the left pane. You see the HTTP headers displayed in a separate pane.

5. Look through the list of HTTP headers to verify that the expected security headers are included in the list. For example, you might see headers similar to those shown in the following screenshot.
